Debugging
========================

Unikernels can't be debugged! J/k.

If you think you found a problem in OPS or Nanos first thing is to
verify where the bug lies. If you are unsure default to OPS.

However, if you open an issue in Nanos please provide the following:

Your OPS profile:
```
âžœ  ~  ops profile
Ops version: 0.1.9
Nanos version: 0.1.25
Qemu version: 4.1.90
Arch: darwin
```

Nightly vs Master?
